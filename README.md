# Workout-Tracker

## Description 

The workout-tracker allows users to record, save and monitor their daily workout, or exercise routines.

## Technology Used

The application has been deployed on Heroku, using Mongo Atlas to access the mongoose database. Code is written in javaScript using the following node.js technologies: express, mongodb, morgan and path. The user-interface is delivered through HTML with css styling. 

## User Experience

As soon as a user logs in, they are presented with the date and details of their last workout including the total duration, the types of exercise performed and the metrics completed like distance or sets. Users then have a choice to either continue the previous workout or to add a new exercise to the program. At any time, users can navigate to the Dashboard where they are presented with cumulative  data for their last seven workouts in graph form.
